object DisjointUnions:

  /** Proves at compile-time that two union types `L` and `R` form a disjoint and exhaustive partition of a sealed type `Parent`.
    *
    * This macro verifies three properties:
    *   1. '''Exhaustiveness''': Every direct subtype of `Parent` is covered by either `L` or `R`
    *      2. '''Disjointness''': No subtype appears in both `L` and `R`
    *      3. '''Validity''': All types in `L` and `R` are actually subtypes of `Parent` (no alien types)
    *
    * If any of these properties are violated, compilation fails with a descriptive error message indicating exactly which types are problematic and how to fix
    * them.
    *
    * ==Usage==
    * {{{
    * sealed trait Animal
    * final case class Dog(name: String) extends Animal
    * final case class Cat(name: String) extends Animal
    * final case class Fish(name: String) extends Animal
    * final case class Bird(name: String) extends Animal
    *
    * // Define two disjoint union types
    * type Mammals = Dog | Cat
    * type NonMammals = Fish | Bird
    *
    * // Prove they partition Animal - compiles successfully!
    * DisjointUnions.prove[Animal, Mammals, NonMammals]
    * }}}
    *
    * ==Error Examples==
    *
    * '''Overlap''' - a type appears in both unions:
    * {{{
    * type Mammals = Dog | Cat
    * type NonMammals = Fish | Bird | Cat // Cat appears in both which is a BUG!
    *
    * DisjointUnions.prove[Animal, Mammals, NonMammals]
    * // Compile error: OVERLAP: 'Cat' appears in both 'Mammals' and 'NonMammals'. Remove it from one of them.
    * }}}
    *
    * '''Missing''' - a subtype is not covered:
    * {{{
    * type Mammals = Dog | Cat
    * type NonMammals = Fish  // Bird is missing which is a BUG!
    *
    * DisjointUnions.prove[Animal, Mammals, NonMammals]
    * // Compile error: MISSING: 'Bird' is not covered by either 'Mammals' or 'NonMammals'. Add it to exactly one.
    * }}}
    *
    * '''Alien''' - a non-subtype sneaks into a union:
    * {{{
    * final case class Robot(id: Int)  // Not an Animal, which is a BUG!
    *
    * type Mammals = Dog | Cat
    * type NonMammals = Fish | Bird | Robot
    *
    * DisjointUnions.prove[Animal, Mammals, NonMammals]
    * // Compile error: ALIEN: 'Robot' in 'NonMammals' is not a subtype of 'Animal'. Remove it from the union.
    * }}}
    *
    * ==Why Use This?==
    *
    * When working with sealed hierarchies, you often want to group subtypes for different handling (e.g., "incorporated" vs "non-incorporated" business types).
    * This macro ensures:
    *   - You don't accidentally put a type in both groups
    *   - You don't forget to classify a new subtype when it's added
    *   - You don't accidentally include unrelated types
    *
    * Place the `prove` call near your type definitions to catch errors early during compilation.
    *
    * @tparam Parent
    *   the sealed parent type whose subtypes should be partitioned
    * @tparam L
    *   the "left" union type (first partition)
    * @tparam R
    *   the "right" union type (second partition)
