object SafeEquals:

  /** Simple safe equals so we don't have to import cats
    *
    * Why use SafeEquals instead of Scala 3's CanEqual?
    *
    *   1. Zero Boilerplate: SafeEquals works immediately for all types in the codebase because it relies on subtyping evidence (<:<) which the compiler
    *      generates automatically. CanEqual requires adding `derives CanEqual` to case classes or defining manual given instances, which is a significant
    *      refactoring effort for existing codebases.
    *   2. Opt-in Usage: SafeEquals allows us to use type-safe equality locally (via ===) without enabling the `strictEquality` language feature globally, which
    *      would break standard `==` usage across the project.
    *   3. Pragmatism: It provides a lightweight, low-friction way to catch equality bugs at compile time without modifying domain models.
